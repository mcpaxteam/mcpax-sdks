# MCP DeFi Integration SDK

This SDK provides a simple way to interact with the MCP DeFi servers.

## Purpose

The purpose of this SDK is to simplify the process of building dApps that consume data from the MCP DeFi servers. It provides a Python interface for accessing the various DeFi-related functionalities offered by the MCP servers.

## Installation

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

```python
from mcp_defi_sdk import MCPDeFiSDK

# Initialize the SDK with the base URL of the MCP server
sdk = MCPDeFiSDK("http://localhost:8000")  # Replace with the actual URL

# Get a DeFi risk score
try:
    risk_score = sdk.get_defi_risk(
        collateral_ratio=0.8, liquidity=0.9, volatility=0.2, market_cap=1000000000
    )
    print(f"DeFi Risk Score: {risk_score}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Get a DAO vote result
try:
    vote_result = sdk.get_dao_vote_result(
        proposal_id=123, voter_weights={"0x123": 0.6, "0x456": 0.4}
    )
    print(f"DAO Vote Result: {vote_result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Get an NFT valuation
try:
    nft_valuation = sdk.get_nft_valuation(
        rarity_score=0.9, market_cap=1000000, trading_volume=10000, artist_reputation=0.7
    )
    print(f"NFT Valuation: {nft_valuation}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Get a lending rate
try:
    lending_rate = sdk.get_lending_rate(
        collateral_type="ETH", loan_duration=30, loan_amount=10000, market_conditions="bullish"
    )
    print(f"Lending Rate: {lending_rate}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Get a stablecoin APY
try:
    stablecoin_apy = sdk.get_stablecoin_apy(
        stablecoin_name="USDT", deposit_amount=1000, lockup_period=30, platform_risk=0.1
    )
    print(f"Stablecoin APY: {stablecoin_apy}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
